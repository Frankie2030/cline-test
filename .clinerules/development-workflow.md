# Development and Deployment

- Use Git for version control; follow clear commit message conventions (e.g., feat: add game board component).
- Use npm for package management; keep dependencies minimal.
- Optimize Vite builds for production with minification and tree-shaking.
- Ensure Vercel deployments are configured for Node.js (Express.js) and static Vue.js assets.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., JWT secrets, database paths).
