# Test Generation Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe Login Website

## 1. General Principles

- **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage for critical parts of the application, especially authentication and game logic. Use coverage reports to identify untested code.

- **Test Pyramid**: Follow the test pyramid principle: have a large base of unit tests, a smaller number of integration tests, and a few end-to-end tests.

- **Isolation**: Tests should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests. Each test should set up its own required state and clean up after itself.

- **Naming Convention**: Use a clear and descriptive naming convention for tests. For example, `test_login_with_valid_credentials_succeeds`.

## 2. Unit Tests

- **Scope**: Unit tests should focus on a single unit of work (e.g., a function or a class method) in isolation. Mock dependencies like databases or external APIs.

- **Authentication**:
  - Test password hashing and verification.
  - Test validation logic for usernames, emails, and passwords (e.g., length, format).
  - Test token generation and validation logic.

- **Game Logic**:
  - Test the game board initialization.
  - Test the logic for making a move (e.g., placing 'X' or 'O' on the board).
  - Test for invalid moves (e.g., placing on an occupied cell, out of bounds).
  - Test win conditions for all possible winning lines (rows, columns, diagonals).
  - Test for a draw condition (board is full, no winner).

## 3. Integration Tests

- **Scope**: Integration tests should verify the interaction between multiple components. For example, testing the login flow from the API endpoint to the database.

- **Login and Registration**:
  - Test the entire registration flow: API request -> user creation in the database.
  - Test the login flow: API request with credentials -> user retrieval -> token generation.
  - Test endpoints with authentication middleware to ensure they are protected.

- **Game API**:
  - Test creating a new game and ensuring it's correctly stored.
  - Test making a move via an API call and verifying the game state is updated.
  - Test retrieving the game state.

## 4. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Scope**: E2E tests should simulate real user scenarios from the user interface to the backend. Use a testing framework like Cypress or Selenium.

- **User Journeys**:
  - **Registration**: A user can navigate to the registration page, fill out the form, submit it, and be logged in.
  - **Login/Logout**: A user can log in with valid credentials, be redirected to the game page, and then log out.
  - **Gameplay**: A logged-in user can start a new game, make moves, and see the game end with a win, loss, or draw.

## Example Test Case (Unit Test for Game Logic)

```python
# (Example in Python using pytest)

def test_check_winner_horizontal():
    # GIVEN a board with a horizontal win for 'X'
    board = [
        ['X', 'X', 'X'],
        ['O', 'O', None],
        [None, None, None]
    ]
    
    # WHEN the winner check function is called
    winner = check_winner(board)
    
    # THEN the winner should be 'X'
    assert winner == 'X'
