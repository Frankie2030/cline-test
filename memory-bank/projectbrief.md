# Project Brief: Online Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 1. Project Overview

This project is to create a web-based, multi-player 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. The application will allow users to register, log in, and play against each other in real-time.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. User Authentication
- **User Registration:** New users can create an account by providing a unique username and a password.
- **User Login:** Registered users can log in to the application using their username and password.
- **Session Management:** The system will maintain user sessions, keeping them logged in until they explicitly log out.

### 2.2. Gameplay
- **Game Lobby:** After logging in, users will enter a lobby where they can see other online players and challenge them to a game.
- **Real-time Gameplay:** The game board will update in real-time for both players as they take turns.
- **Turn-based System:** The game will enforce turns, allowing a player to make a move only when it is their turn.
- **Win/Draw Detection:** The system will automatically detect win conditions (three in a row, column, or diagonal) or a draw (all cells filled with no winner).
- **Game Over State:** Once a game ends, the result will be displayed to both players, and they will have the option to request a rematch or return to the lobby.

## 3. Target Audience

- Casual gamers looking for a quick and simple online game.
- Friends who want to play a classic game against each other over the internet.

## 4. Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** A responsive web interface that works on modern web browsers.
- **Backend:** A server to handle user authentication, session management, game logic, and real-time communication between players.
- **Database:** A database to store user credentials (usernames and hashed passwords).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Performance:** The game should be responsive with minimal latency.
- **Security:** User passwords must be securely hashed and stored.
