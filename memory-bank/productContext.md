# Product Context: Online Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 1. Problem Statement

There is a lack of simple, easily accessible, and ad-free platforms for playing classic games like Tic-Tac-Toe with friends online. Many existing options are bloated with unnecessary features, require complex sign-up processes, or are filled with intrusive advertisements, detracting from the core experience.

## 2. Vision & Solution

Our vision is to provide a clean, straightforward, and enjoyable online environment for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. The solution is a web application that focuses exclusively on the game itself, with a simple authentication system and a minimal, intuitive interface. The platform will enable two users to connect and play a game in real-time without any friction.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity:** The user journey from landing on the page to starting a game should be as short and simple as possible.
- **Clarity:** The interface will be clean and uncluttered. Game status, whose turn it is, and the final outcome will always be clearly communicated.
- **Responsiveness:** The game should feel fast and responsive, with immediate feedback for every action a player takes.
- **Engagement:** While simple, the ability to challenge friends and have a quick rematch should encourage repeat engagement.
