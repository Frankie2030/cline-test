# Tech Context: Online Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 1. Frontend

- **Framework:** Vue.js (v3)
  - **Reasoning:** Vue's component-based architecture and gentle learning curve make it ideal for this project's scope. Its reactivity system is well-suited for a dynamic game board.
- **Build Tool:** Vite
  - **Reasoning:** Provides a fast development server and optimized build process out-of-the-box.
- **Styling:** CSS with BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention for maintainable and scalable styles. No CSS frameworks will be used to keep the project lightweight.
- **State Management:** Pinia
  - **Reasoning:** The official state management library for Vue 3, offering a simple and intuitive API.

## 2. Backend

- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
  - **Reasoning:** A minimal and flexible Node.js framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It's more than sufficient for the REST API needed here.
- **Real-time Communication:** `ws` (WebSocket) library
  - **Reasoning:** A lightweight, high-performance WebSocket library for Node.js that integrates easily with Express.
- **Authentication:** `jsonwebtoken` for creating and verifying JWTs, and `bcrypt` for hashing passwords.

## 3. Database

- **Database:** SQLite
  - **Reasoning:** For a simple application with basic user storage needs, SQLite is a perfect choice. It's serverless, self-contained, and requires no complex setup. The database will be a single file in the project.
- **ORM/Query Builder:** `sqlite3` Node.js package for direct database interaction. An ORM like Sequelize would be overkill.

## 4. Development & Deployment

- **Version Control:** Git, with a repository hosted on GitHub.
- **Package Manager:** `npm` for both frontend and backend dependency management.
- **Development Environment:** A monorepo structure might be considered, with `package.json` scripts to run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
- **Deployment:** Vercel or a similar platform that supports Node.js backends and static site hosting for the frontend.
